# Development Strategy

 app-theme

write a short description of your project:

This week's project is to study the app-theme tutorial from Traversy Media and to rebuild the website having four pages. It is expected to submit my code from his tutorial in a new repository on my GitHub account generated from this starter template. My repository is named app-theme and codes developed with one branch per step; create pull request to the mater and merge it to the master. The goal of this project is to practice planning and building clean project in a structured way. The strategy to follow for completing this project involves three steps:

Follow the tutorial, studying the code and understanding the project.
Look over the finished code and break it down into steps, write my development strategy.
Study the tutorial for the second time, following my development strategy to build my repository one branch at a time.          

Also to create a wireframe, also make use of the project board to work on the issues. Also use the FlexBox CSS Layout to build a a responsive HTML template; make use of a CSS framework called Flexboxgrid.

GO TO THE README

- who would want to use it?

For a beginner, this project covers the CSS Flexbox Layout. Learn how to create and work with branches, how to develop a strategy to build this project.

- why would they want to use it?

Flexbox is a relatively new front-end feature that makes building a website layout much more easier than it used to be; it is a great tool to use for responsive design systems.

## Wireframe

<!-- include a wireframe for your project in this repository, and display it here -->
